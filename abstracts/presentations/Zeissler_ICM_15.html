<p>Advances in nanotechnology have enabled the creation of complex single domain ferromagnetic constructs, allowing the study of ferromagnetic interactions influenced by geometry. Artificial spin ice is such a playground which marries geometrical order with magnetic frustration. Recently published measurements have shown unusual features in the magnetotransport signature of cobalt and permalloy honeycomb artificial spin ice below 50 K and 20 K respectively [1,2]. Here we explore the changes in the magnetic reversal of a connected artificial spin ice array fabricated from permalloy below and above this transition temperature using magnetic force microscopy. The imaging shows a change in the magnetic reversal process at low temperatures, which results in a striking number of ice rule violations. These ice rule violations are rare occurrences at room temperature in permalloy arrays where switching occurs via propagation of transverse domain walls [3-5]. We present a link between the domain wall chirality with our low temperature observations.</p>
