<p>Dual-beam FIB/SEM has become a very popular tool in nanomagnetism research. It can be used to manufacture nanostructures with resolution down to 10 nm by subtractive milling as well as modifying the local magnetic properties such as coercive field and remnant magnetisation. The latter can be achieved by ion beam induced interface mixing and strain relaxation between two different layers.</p>
		
<p>We present a complete process for the fabrication of nanowires and associated circuitry needed to perform pulsed field and current measurements on nanowires by a combination of ion beam milling and e-beam lithography by using FIB.</p>

<p>We also tried to tailor the switching field in NiFe nanowires by sinusoidally modulating the wire edges with periodicity and amplitude of modulation precisely varied by FIB. Ion induced local changes in magnetic properties and chemical composition were also investigated by MOKE and EDX techniques, respectively.</p>
