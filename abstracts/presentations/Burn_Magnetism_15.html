<p>Geometrically patterned magnetic nanostructures supporting individual magnetic domain walls (DWs) have been extensively studied due to the potential impact from the development of novel technological devices. Our current understanding has led to the development of magnetic meta-material systems such as artificial spin ice. Here, the collective behaviour originates from the DWs as they interact with the vertices between many interconnected nanowire structures.[1,2]</p>

<p>In this work, spatially resolved magnetisation reversal behaviour in a kagome structure is investigated through focussed MOKE magnetometry. With a combination of spatially uniform quasi-static fields and localised pulsed fields, the role of DWs in the reversal process has been investigated.[3] Localisation of the DW injection field allows the DW propagation behaviour to be probed at fields below the intrinsic nucleation field in the system. This behaviour can be differentiated from that associated with the boundary effects resulting from the edges of the structure. Furthermore, varying the applied field direction around particular symmetry can bias the DW propagation and vertex interactions giving further insight into the interactions taking place in these structures.</p>

<p>This research builds on our understanding of complex interconnected magnetic systems and opens pathways to further explore the manipulation of magnetic charges[4] and potential technological applications.</p>
