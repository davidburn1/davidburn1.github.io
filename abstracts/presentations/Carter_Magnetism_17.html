<p>Networks of interacting magnetic nanostructures including artificial spin ice (ASI) have provided vast amounts of physical insight in recent years[1,2,3,4], in part due to their ability to model complex systems[5] and exhibit exotic phenomena such as magnetic monopole-like states[6]. The power of these networks stems from the extraordinary number of unique microstates, even in systems comprising relatively few nanostructures. </p>

<p>However, ASI and related architectures are yet to realise their full potential as the majority of microstates remain inaccessible due to the rudimentary state-writing tools currently available. Researchers largely resort to global field protocols to stochastically select spin-configurations from a vastly reduced microstate space. An experimental means to prepare all potential microstates has huge implications, including realising ASI as a tunable-bandgap magnonic crystal[7] or reconfigurable neural-network[8]. </p>

<p>We present a novel MFM-tip based state writing technique, building on our previously demonstrated domain-wall injection process[9]. It requires no global fields and is applicable to all nanostructure architectures, providing total control over the spin-configuration and access to every possible microstate. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method via the realisation of several exotic and thus-far unobserved states, unachievable via global field-protocols: magnetic monopole-defect chains and the spin-crystal ground state[10] of kagome ASI. </p>
