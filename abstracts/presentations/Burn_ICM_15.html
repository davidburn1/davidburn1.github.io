<p>Magnetic meta-materials exhibit interesting and complex magnetisation behaviour which originates from nanoscale patterning in addition to the intrinsic properties of the magnetic material. Artificial spin ice is one such example where interconnected magnetic nanowires are arranged in a kagome network. Here, the collective behaviour originates from multiple magnetic domain walls (DWs) which propagate along nanowires and interact at vertices.[1,2] </p>

<p>In this work, spatially resolved magnetisation reversal behaviour in a kagome artificial spin ice structure is investigated through focussed MOKE magnetometry. With the application of a magnetic field, magnetisation reversal due to the nucleation and propagation of magnetic DWs is observed. Varying the applied field direction relative to symmetry axes in the patterning allows us to bias particular sub-lattice directions giving physical insight into the DW propagation and vertex interactions taking place.</p>

<p>Localised pulsed-field injection techniques[3] allow the DW propagation behaviour to be probed at fields below the intrinsic nucleation field of the system. This means that the relative influence of the DW nucleation and propagation processes upon the magnetisation reversal can be differentiated. Furthermore, the localisation of the DW injection shows behaviour associated with the bulk of the sample in comparison to that resulting from boundary effects at the edges of the structure. </p>

<p>This research builds on our understanding of complex interconnected magnetic systems and opens pathways to further explore the manipulation of magnetic charges[4] and potential technological applications.</p>
