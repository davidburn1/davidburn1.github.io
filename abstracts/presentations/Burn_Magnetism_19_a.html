<p>Ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) is a standard technique for measuring magnetisation dynamics in thin film, multilayered and single crystal systems. The absorption of a RF magnetic signal supplied from a co-planar waveguide reveals the field and frequency dependence to the magnetic resonance in the sample. However, this technique comes with limitations, for example it is not possible to determine the origin of resonance modes in complex multilayered structures typically used in magnetism research today.
    <p>By combining FMR measurements with x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) it is possible to overcome this limitation by exploiting the element selectivity available with x-ray absorption measurements. X-ray detected ferromagnetic resonance (XFMR) works by synchronising RF excitation of the sample with pulsed x-rays available at a synchrotron we stroboscopically probe the absorption as a function of pump-probe delay revealing the element specific magnetodynamics at picoseconds timescales [1,2].
    <p>We present a selection of recent XFMR results, including spin pumping across spin valves and spin transfer across a topological insulators [3-7], outlining the operating principles of the technique and the valuable insights it offers [8].
