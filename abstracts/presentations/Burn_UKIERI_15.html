<p>Magnetic meta-materials exhibit interesting and complex magnetisation behaviour which originates from nanoscale patterning in addition to the intrinsic properties of the magnetic material. Artificial spin ice is one such example where an array of magnetic nanowires are connected by vertices to form a kagome structure. The nucleation and propagation of magnetic domain walls (DWs) is the predominant magnetisation reversal process for magnetic nanowires. However, complexities in the behaviour of artificial spin ice systems arise due to DW interactions at the vertices[1,2] and the flow of magnetic charge throughout system[3].</p>

<p>In this work, spatially resolved magnetisation reversal behaviour in a kagome artificial spin ice structure is investigated through focussed MOKE magnetometry. With an applied field the nucleation and propagation of magnetic DWs is observed throughout the array. Varying the applied field direction relative to symmetry axes in the patterning biases particular sub-lattice directions giving physical insight into the DW propagation and vertex interactions taking place. Additional localised pulsed-field injection techniques[4] allow the DW propagation behaviour to be explored at fields below the intrinsic nucleation field of the system. This allows further characterisation of the DW - vertex interaction and gives control over the DW nucleation location.</p>

<p>This research builds on our understanding of complex interconnected magnetic systems and opens pathways to further explore the manipulation of magnetic charges[5] and their use in potential technological applications.</p>
