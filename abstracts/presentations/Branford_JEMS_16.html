<p>Artificial Spin Ice is a magnetic meta-material, where the nano-elements act as macrosized spins. The magnetic
    properties are governed by the collective behaviour of the macrospins in addition to the magnetic material. He we
    study honeycomb Artificial Spin Ice, where interconnected magnetic nanobars are arranged in a kagome network.
    The collective behaviour originates from the â€˜ice rulesâ€™ local ordering principle and also magnetic domain wall (DW)
    effects.[1,2]. The structures are rather interesting for data storage if a methodology can be developed to controllably
    select a single microstate of the array.[3]</p>
    
    <p>Here we explore spatially selective methods of magnetization reversing within the array, including selective domain wall propagation [1,2] off-axis global fields4 and injection of domain walls with locally applied fields from striplines and an MFM tip. The spatially resolved magnetisation reversal behaviour is imaged using MFM and focussed MOKE magnetometry.</p>
    
    <p>This research builds on our understanding of complex interconnected magnetic systems and opens pathways to
    further explore the manipulation of magnetic charges5 and potential technological applications.</p>
