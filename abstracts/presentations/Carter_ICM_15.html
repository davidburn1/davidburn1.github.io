<p> Domain walls (DWs) in magnetic nanostructures have long been a subject of much interest . The majority of work so far has focused on 90 and 180 DWs. However, recently the field has seen promising developments in 360 DWs, stable topological defects consisting of two strongly-coupled 180 DWs of opposite chirality. </p>

<p>360 DWs have several unique properties. They are stationary under applied magnetic fields , interact interestingly with spin-waves  and have a small stray field, desirable for systems such as racetrack memory[4].</p>

<p>Current methods for generating 360 DWs rely on fabricating injection structures and applying rotating fields  or current pulses . These techniques have several drawbacks including additional nanofabrication steps and the application of global magnetic fields.</p>

<p>We present a novel method for injecting 360 DWs into nanowires via MFM tip.  Experimental evidence is presented from MFM images and supported by micromagnetic simulations. The method avoids fabricating injection structures and global field/current application. Additional benefits include localised injection via precise tip positioning and chirality selection of injected DWs.</p>
