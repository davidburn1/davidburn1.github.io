<p>The combination of an electron column and Ga<sup>+</sup> ion source in a single instrument makes the Dual Beam FIB / SEM a versatile instrument for nanoscale device fabrication and structural analysis.</p>

<p>We have investigated the changes in magnetic properties within NiFe / Au bilayers induced by low dose Ga<sup>+</sup> irradiation. A rise in coercivity with dose is found up to a critical dose where magnetic properties become quenched. With focused beams, local control over magnetic properties is used to create domain wall pinning sites in nanowires and will ultimately allow artificial domain structures to be created.</p>

<p>Following irradiation, electron microscopy and EDX compositional analysis give information from the sample surface whilst magneto-optical techniques are used to probe the magnetic properties. Together with models of ion interactions within these materials they give an insight into the processes such as Ga<sup>+</sup> implantation and intermixing which bring about the changes in magnetic properties resulting from Ga<sup>+</sup> irradiation.</p>
