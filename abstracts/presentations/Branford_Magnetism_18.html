<p>Networks of magnetic nanostructures are of broad interest from novel data storage and computation to
    magnonic crystals. One family of nanomagnetic arrays, characvterized by strong and frustrated magnetic
    interactions are the artificial spin ices (ASI). ASI structures have provided vast amounts of physical insight in
    recent years [1,2,3,4] in part due to their ability to model complex systems [5] and exhibit exotic
    phenomena such as â€˜magnetic monopoleâ€™-like states [6]. The power of these networks stems from the
    extraordinary number of unique microstates, even in systems comprising relatively few nanostructures.
    However, magnetic nanoarrays in general, and ASI structures in particular, have yet to realise their full
    potential as the majority of microstates remain inaccessible due to the rudimentary state-writing tools
    currently available. An experimental means to prepare all potential microstates has huge implications,
    including realising ASI as a tunable-bandgap magnonic crystal [7] or reconfigurable neural-network [8]. We
    present a novel MFM-tip based state writing technique, building on our previously demonstrated domain-wall
    injection process [9]. It requires no global fields and is applicable to all nanostructure architectures,
    providing control over the spin-configuration and access to every possible microstate. We demonstrate our
    method via realisation of several exotic and thus-far unobserved states, unachievable via global fieldprotocols:
    â€˜magnetic monopole-defectâ€™ chains and the spin-crystal ground state [10] of kagome ASI.<br>
