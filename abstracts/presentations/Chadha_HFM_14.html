<p>Ferromagnetic nano-dot arrays are interesting for data storage applications, but as the density of disks becomes high the dipolar interactions between disks become strong. In this work we study lithographically prepared arrays of densely packed single domain permalloy nano-disks where the dipolar correlations are significant. We study the collective magnetic array properties for different array geometries and varying disk separation and explore the effect of magnetic frustration in these systems.</p>
