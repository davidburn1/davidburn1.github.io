    We investigate the temperature-dependent electronic structure of the van der Waals ferromagnet, CrGeTe$_3$. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we identify atomic- and orbital-specific band shifts upon cooling through $T_C$. From these, together with x-ray absorption spectroscopy and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism measurements, we identify the states created by a covalent bond between the Te $5p$ and the Cr $e_g$ orbitals as the primary driver of the ferromagnetic ordering in this system, while it is the Cr $t_{2g}$ states that carry the majority of the spin moment. The $t_{2g}$ states furthermore exhibit a marked bandwidth increase and a remarkable lifetime enhancement upon entering the ordered phase, pointing to a delicate interplay between localized and itinerant states in this family of layered ferromagnets.
