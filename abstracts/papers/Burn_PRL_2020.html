    Magnetic multilayers offer diverse opportunities for the development of ultrafast functional devices through advanced interface and layer engineering. Nevertheless, a method for determining their dynamic properties as a function of depth throughout such stacks has remained elusive. By probing the ferromagnetic resonance modes with element-selective soft x-ray resonant reflectivity, we gain access to the magnetization dynamics as a function of depth. Most notably, using reflectometry ferromagnetic resonance, we find a phase lag between the coupled ferromagnetic layers in [CoFeB/MgO/Ta]$_4$ multilayers that is invisible to other techniques. The use of reflectometry ferromagnetic resonance enables the time-resolved and depth-resolved probing of the complex magnetization dynamics of a wide range of functional magnetic heterostructures with absorption edges in the soft x-ray wavelength regime.
