    The influence of interfacial intermixing on the picosecond magnetization dynamics of ferromagnetic/non-magnetic thin-film bilayers was studied. Low-dose focused-ion-beam irradiation was used to induce intermixing across the interface between a 10 nm Ni<sub>81</sub>Fe<sub>19</sub> layer and a 2–3 nm capping layer of either Au or Cr. Time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect was used to study magnetization dynamics as a function of ion-beam dose. With an Au cap, the damping of the un-irradiated bilayer was comparable with native Ni<sub>81</sub>Fe<sub>19</sub> and increased with increasing ion dose. In contrast, for Ni<sub>81</sub>Fe<sub>19</sub>/Cr the damping was higher than that for native Ni<sub>81</sub>Fe<sub>19</sub>, but the damping decreased with increasing dose.
