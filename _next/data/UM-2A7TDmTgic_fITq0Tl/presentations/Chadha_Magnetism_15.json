Until recently, macroscopic understanding of the dynamic magnetization behavior in such materials was obtained through ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) measurements where micromagnetic simulations and theoretical modelling were used to predict the microscopic behavior. Here we present our recently developed synchrotron-based x-ray technique with the ability to uniquely resolve the dynamic magnetization behavior as a function of depth through magnetic multilayered systems [1-3]. Reflectometry ferromagnetic resonance (RFMR) brings together the power of two synchrotron x-ray based techniques: Firstly, x-ray detected ferromagnetic resonance (XFMR) provides a element-specific and time-resolved probe to explore the magnetization dynamics [4,5]. Secondly, soft x-ray reflectivity provides a measure of the depth dependence to both the chemical and magnetic structure through multilayered systems. In combination, RFMR reveals new and unique insights into the magnetization dynamics exhibited in layers beneath the surface in multilayered structures. We will present new understanding gained from such layer resolved measurements of the magnetization dynamics in a [CoFeB/MgO/Ta]4 multilayer structure. As expected, each of the magnetic layers exhibit a ferromagnetic resonance behavior. However, in contrast to a single magnetic thin film, additional coupling between the layers results in a phase lag relationship between the dynamics in adjacent layers [1].\n</p>\n\n<p>[1] <a href=\"/publications/Burn_PRL_2020\">D.M.

The dependence of the magnetic behaviour of Mn ions on their local magnetic environment has been well documented3. Therefore, a thin Mn layer inserted into the soft layer of a hard-soft bilayer can act as a probe of the soft layer magnetisation at a certain depth without disrupting the magnetic state4. Consequently, we have studied the influence of the Mn thickness on the static and dynamic magnetisation properties of L10 FePt/NiFe/Mn/NiFe thin films to find an ideal thickness for the Mn ‚Äòspy layer‚Äô.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA series of samples with nominal structure MgO(110)/ L10 FePt(110) (100√Ö)/ NiFe(200√Ö)/ Mn(ùë•ùë• √Ö)/ NiFe(200√Ö) were fabricated by sputtering with ùë•ùë• = 0, 5 and 10√Ö. X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) was used to obtain element-specific hysteresis loops in order to explore the switching of the individual constituent layers (see Fig. 1). For ùë•ùë• = 0 or 5√Ö, the entire multilayer switches as a single rigid magnet. When ùë•ùë• = 10√Ö, the Mn layer appears to decouple the upper and lower NiFe layers. We explain the observed switching by attributing the Mn signal to two distinct Mn rich regions, each of which is strongly coupled to one of the NiFe layers. From VNA-FMR and XFMR measurements, we deduce that the upper NiFe layer resonance drives precession in one of the Mn rich regions as intended.\n</p>\n\n<img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"/images/presentations/abstract_figs/Newman_Magnetism_2021.png\"/>\n\n<p>\n    Figure 1: XMCD hysteresis loops for Mn (blue), Ni (black) and Fe (red) obtained from samples with Mn layers of different thickness as indicated.

The tuneability of this structure (through variation of the Ni3Pt deposition temperature and the thickness of each layer) provides an ideal system with which to investigate the effect of M(T), K(T) and Jij(T) on reversal mechanisms within SFMs, with the additional benefit of distinct magnetic species allowing for element and layer specific characterisation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n    Initial pump/probe experiments reveal that it is possible to switch these SFMs by application of optical laser pulses under only a small applied field. Full optical switching requires stronger antiferromagnetic exchange coupling than can currently be achieved in Ni3Pt/Ir/Co SFMs, as a result of the elevated deposition temperatures necessary for PMA in Ni3Pt. A possible solution is to replace the Ni3Pt layer with a Ni/Pt multilayer, in which PMA can be achieved by careful choice of layer thickness. This gives scope for improving the exchange coupling by removing the cooling step during deposition, while also maintaining element specificity and tuneability of the magnetic properties.\n</p>\n\n\n<img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"/images/presentations/abstract_figs/Scott_Magnetism_2021.jpg\"/>\n\n<p>\n    Figure 1: Remanent magnetisation as a function of temperature of a Ni3Pt(7nm)/Ir(0.4nm)/Co(1nm) SFM with arrows depicting this sample‚Äôs layer alignment, Co (green) and Ni3Pt (red, solid), and noting the positions of the magnetisation compensation point, Tcomp and T-MR, the onset temperature of negative remanent magnetisation.

In particular, it has been observed that thin NiO films not only transmit but can also enhance a spin current [1, 2]. So far experiments have been limited to the detection of dc spin current and mainly performed on polycrystalline NiO layers. By employing element specific x-ray ferromagnetic resonance (XFMR) [3] we demonstrate transport of an ac spin-current across epitaxial NiO(001) layers, generated via spin pumping within adjacent NiFe layers. We show that in the case of a FeCo/NiO/NiFe multilayer, magnetization precession at the resonant frequency of the NiFe is also observed in the FeCo, with the phase of the precession being very similar in both layers. The amplitude of the precession of the sink FeCo layer (which is a measure of the amplitude of the spin current propagating through NiO) depends on the NiO thickness.  The amplitude reaches a maximum at 6 nm and decays exponentially above this thickness (see Fig.1), in a similar manner to that in both previous experimental reports concerning the dc spin current [1, 2] and theoretical studies [4, 5]. </p>\n\n<p>For comparison, we present results for FeCo/NM(5nm)/NiO/NiFe multilayers, where the NiO is decoupled from the sink layer by insertion of a 5 nm thick non-magnetic (NM) layer of Ag or Pd. Although the magnetization precession of the FeCo sink layer at the NiFe resonance can be observed, its amplitude is nearly one order of magnitude smaller than for the case of directly coupled layers. Furthermore, we observe that the precession of the sink layer is characterized by a bipolar variation of the phase that is a signature of spin transfer torque due to propagation of ac spin current through the NiO layer [3]. Our results confirm the propagation of ac spin current within NiO layers mediated by coherent magnons, rather than by the diffusion of thermal magnons.   </p>\n\n<img class=\"img-fluid text-center\" src=\"/images/presentations/abstract_figs/Dabrowski_MMM_19.jpg\"></img>\n\n<p> Figure 1.

ES structures are therefore attractive for future data storage device applications such as heat-assisted-magnetic recording (HAMR). In this work we explore the magnetization dynamics of ESs with different magnetic anisotropies and different soft/hard layer thicknesses using time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect (TRMOKE) measurements. We start with epitaxial Laves phase DyFe2/YFe2 structures with in-plane magnetic anisotropy, where winding and precession within the soft YFe2 layers in the [DyFe2(2nm)/YFe2(8nm)]x40 superlattice structure is demonstrated [1]. We show that the ES magnetization dynamics strongly depends upon the magnetic bias field orientation. In particular, for the magnetic field applied along the in-plane hard axis, the magnetization dynamics of the spring can be continuously excited in the field range from 0.5 T down to remanence, allowing the precession to be observed over a wide frequency range of 2.5‚Äì16 GHz. In contrast, for a DyFe2(30nm)/YFe2(7.5nm)/DyFe2(30nm) trilayer ES structure with substantially thicker hard layer and stronger in-plane magnetic anisotropy, the magnetization precession of the spring is heavily damped, with virtually no oscillations observed beyond an inflection point at around 30 ps after excitation by the fs laser pulse, regardless of the applied magnetic field direction and the pump laser fluence. Finally, we present a [Co(0.4nm)/Pt(0.9nm)]x10/Py(10nm) bilayer structure, where a 90¬∞ exchange spring between out-of-plane and in-plane magnetization orientation is formed within the Co/Pt layers. We show that for the field applied perpendicular to the sample plane the magnetization precession can be observed over a wide frequency range of 2.5‚Äì21 GHz. The precession is even present at the highest available magnetic field of 1.5 T, suggesting mutual imprinting of the spin configuration between the layers [2].  </p>\n\n<p>[1] L. R. Shelford, Y.

Such a structure can be realised with an exchange spring. These are usually engineered with anisotropies such that the moments of both hard and soft layers are aligned in the same direction, either in-plane (IP) or out-of-plane (OoP). If instead the hard and soft layers have different anisotropy directions (IP and OoP) then the exchange coupling creates a canted magnetic state at remanence. Using x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) and x-ray ferromagnetic resonance (XFMR) at the Co and Fe L2,3 edges [4], at both the Advanced Light Source in the US and the Diamond Light Source in the UK, we have studied the effect of inserting a Pt spacer layer on the exchange coupling within [Co/Pt]/(Pt)/Py (tri-)bi-layer exchange springs with canted magnetic moments (Py = Fe20Ni80).</p>\n\n<p> Samples of Pt(300)/[Co(2)/Pt(9)]10/Pt(x)/Py(y)/Pt(30) (thickness in √Ö) were grown on Al2O3 (11-20) substrates, using DC magnetron sputtering, with x = 0 and 15 √Ö and y = 550 and 100 √Ö. By making the Py layer (y = 550 √Ö) thick compared to the 110 √Ö [Co/Pt] layer, the Co moments are canted from the OoP direction. Element resolved hysteresis loops, measured by XMCD, show that the IP shape anisotropy of the Py dominates and pulls the Co moments from their preferred OoP direction towards the IP direction. Using the thinner Py layer, the Py at the interface is instead canted towards the OoP direction, while the Py magnetization relaxes towards the in-plane direction away from the interface. By inserting a Pt spacer layer, the exchange coupling was decreased, resulting in Co moments that were less strongly canted. For samples with the thickness in this study a static exchange coupling was always observed. The canting of the moments is in agreement with work by Hsu and Saravanan et al. [1, 5].</p>\n\n<p>The dynamic exchange coupling between the layers was investigated using XFMR which gives the element resolved FMR. XFMR measurements performed with an IP bias field confirmed that the [Co/Pt] and Py layers are strongly coupled in the samples without the Pt spacer. For a 4GHz RF field, both Co and Fe exhibit a resonance field of 20mT, while in the sample with a Pt spacer only the Fe exhibits a resonance for an IP bias field. See Fig 1 for IP field scans of the resonance amplitude measured by XFMR at the Fe and Co L2,3 edges for a 4GHz RF-field. Vector network analyser FMR (VNA-FMR) was also performed with biasing field IP and OoP. VNA-FMR with IP biasing field was in agreement with the XFMR, while for OoP there was a complex behaviour.</p>\n\n<img class=\"img-fluid text-center\" src=\"/images/presentations/abstract_figs/Frisk_JEMS_19.jpg\"></img>\n\n<ol>\n    <li>J.-H.

Here we present our recent studies on the magnetic characterization of chiral magnets, using resonant elastic x-ray scattering (REXS). We demonstrate the unique advantages of REXS that allow for the study of the microscopic structural information of skyrmions, inaccessible to other characterization techniques. First, we show that REXS is extremely surface sensitive [1], which allows for the probing of the multidomain skyrmion lattice state - a surface state of the skyrmion lattice [2]. Second, the variable probing area allows us to map out the real-space skyrmion domain structure [3], which is important for future applications. Third, we show that using circularly polarised light, REXS is capable to accurately determine the topological winding number of a skyrmion, rigorously following its mathematical definition [4]. This 'topology determination principle' is a general experimental strategy, applicable to a wide range of topologically ordered magnetic materials.

A circular field gradient alone is sufficient to drive collective and continuous rotation of the skyrmion lattice.

So far resistance changes as a function of magnetisation, known as magnetoresistance, has been most extensively explored. Now electrical control of the magnetisation is becoming a more popular avenue to explore [1]. In particular, systems with a magnetic layer and a layer with high spin-orbit coupling give rise to interesting interfacial effects. An electrical charge current in the high spin-orbit layer generates a transverse spin current.

Damping has, therefore, received significant research effort, both in terms of the fundamental physics involved and for technological applications. In general, the control of magnetic properties at the micro- and nano-scale is important for technological applications. Focused ion beam irradiation provides the opportunity for such highly-localised control and modification of magnetic properties. Here the influence of interfacial intermixing on the picosecond precessional magnetisation dynamics of ferromagnetic/non-magnetic thin-film bilayers was studied [1]. Low-dose focused-ion-beam irradiation was shown to affect various aspects of the intrinsic magnetisation behaviour in such bilayers [2]. The influence on damping of ion-beam induced intermixing across the interface between a 10 nm Ni<sub>81</sub>Fe<sub>19</sub> layer and a 2-3 nm capping layer of either Au or Cr was studied here.

Furthermore, field-dependent damping measurements of the NiFe/Au films showed the damping decreased steadily with increasing frequency, indicating an extrinsic two-magnon type contribution to the damping, that may be attributed to increasing disorder at the interface. This contrasts with the behavior observed for MBE grown Au on Fe, where the damping was enhanced by spin-pumping effects. For the NiFe/Cr the damping was invariant with increasing precessional frequency. This indicates an enhancement of the intrinsic damping with Cr cap, which contrasts with the effect of Cr on Fe observed for MBE grown samples reported elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p> [1] <a href=\"#!/publications/King_APL_2014\">J.A.

The shape of each nanomagnets controls the magnetic anisotropy and the elements are closely spaced so dipolar interactions are important. Lattices are chosen such that the geometry prevents all dipole interactions from being satisfied. The building block of such frustrated lattices is the equilateral triangle because it cannot support simple antiparallel ordering. A two dimensional array of corner sharing triangles is known as the kagome lattice and a three-dimensional array of corner sharing tetrahedral is known as pyrochlore. Magnetic pyrochlore chemical compounds (spin ices) have recently attracted much attention with the observation of emergent magnetic monopoles, but they have limitations as model frustrated systems: tuning the lattice parameter by chemical doping tends to break the symmetry, specific defects cannot be engineered and the spins cannot be directly imaged. The use of frustrated artificial nanostructures overcomes these problems through the tremendous versatility in array fabrication and compatibility with a suite of magnetic imaging techniques. Here I will show direct magnetic imaging studies of monopole defects [1-2] and magnetic charge flow.

With due care to the experimental arrangement MOKE magnetometry can be exquisitely sensitive  to magnetisation changes and can be used to study magnetisation reversal in lithographically patterned structures such as small arrays of nanostructures and individual nanowires. Using the functionally simpler quasi-static focused MOKE arrangement, magnetisation reversal behaviour can be studied as a function of magnetic field. The magnetisation state can be interrogated during the reversal in the case of field driven rotational processes. However, in the case of rapid reversals, for example mediated by domain wall motion in nanowires, the magnetisation process can be followed by interrogating the magnetisation state before and after switching. In the latter case this also presents the opportunity to make multiple measurements and study the stochastic nature of the processes. For lithographically patterned nanostructures typical structures have thicknesses ranging from a few nanometres up to 20 nm. Since the MOKE sensitivity is limited by the skin-depth to the order of 20 nm the technique is highly suited to interrogating the entire thickness of such nanostructures. </p>\n\n<p>Examples of MOKE measurements on such lithographic nanostructures will be discussed.

Here examples are included which show that under appropriate circumstances the MOKE amplitude obtained from quasistatic measurements can be used to inform on the changes in intrinsic magnetic moment. The method does not give absolute magnetic moment but can show relative changes in moment that can be correlated with direct moment measurements. Furthermore, dynamic MOKE magnetometry is a powerful technique that can be used to study intrinsic precessional magnetisation processes and inform on the magnetic damping. Here examples of the application of MOKE magnetometry to the study of precessional processes are presented that show modifications to the damping in ferromagnetic/non-magnetic bilayered samples by the choice of the non-magnetic layer and the effect of ion beam induced interfacial mixing.</p>"},{"key":"Burn_DICNMA_13","title":"Magnetisation reversal and domain wall propagation behaviour in edge modulated nanowire structures","authors":"D.M.

This dip in magnetisation is also coincident with a maximum in the anisotropic magnetoresistance ratio (AMR) despite an increase in average resistivity.</p>\n\n<p>These results indicate that low dose irradiation can have a significant effect on the magnetic moment and from the AMR, on the spin-orbit coupling.</p>"},{"key":"Burn_York_Tohoku_11","title":"Control of electronic and magnetic behaviour in NiFe/Au nanostructures by Ga<sup>+</sup> irradiation","authors":"<u>D.M.

The maximum operating speeds and reliability of such devices are ultimately limited by the switching behaviour taking place within thin-films inside the device. Thus, understanding the physical processes of magnetisation change in thin-films in response to very rapid magnetic field changes has significance for potential applications.</p> \n\t\t\n<p>Here we present experimental results for magnetisation switching in a NiFe thin-film measured using magneto-optic Kerr effect magnetometry. Pulsed magnetic fields from 10 ns to 1 us are created using a pulser circuit and microstrip line. These combine with a quasi-static field resulting in a total field which induces switching in the sample. When this total field exceeds the coercive field with a positive quasi-static contribution, successful switching is observed. As the quasi-static component is reduced but with total fields still in excess of the coercive field, complex switching behaviour arises which results in incomplete switching for large total fields. Figure 1a shows the experimental results where a change in behaviour occurs between positive and negative offset fields.</p>\n\t\t\n<p>A qualitative model has been constructed to explain this complex behaviour where magnetisation switching in a thin-film takes place by the propagation of domain walls.
