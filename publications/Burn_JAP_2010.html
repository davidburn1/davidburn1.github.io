It is confirmed that the dependence of the intensity on the magnetic moment can be linear, quadratic or a combination of both, depending on the polarization of the incident X-ray beam and the direction of the magnetic moment. With a linearly polarized beam, the scattered intensity will have a purely quadratic dependence on the magnetic moment when the magnetic moment is parallel to the scattering plane. However, with the magnetic moment perpendicular to the scattering plane, there is also a linear component. This means that, when measuring the hysteresis with linear polarization during a hysteresis cycle, the intensity will be an even function of the applied field when the change in the magnetic moment (and field) is confined within the scattering plane but becomes more complicated when the magnetic moment is out of the scattering plane. Furthermore, with circular polarization, the dependence of the scattered intensity on the moment is a combination of linear and quadratic. With the moment parallel to the scattering plane, the linear component changes with the helicity of the incident beam. Surprisingly, in stark contrast to absorption studies, even when the magnetic moment is perpendicular to the scattering plane there is still a dependence on the moment with a linear component. This linear component is completely independent of the helicity of the beam, meaning that the hysteresis loops will not be inverted with helicity."},{"key":"Burn_Nanotechnology_2023","title":"Spin pumping through nanocrystalline topological insulators","authors":"D.M Burn, J-C Lin, R.

Common spin-based devices, such as spin valves, rely on trilayer structures in which a non-magnetic layer is sandwiched between two ferromagnetic (FM) layers. The major disadvantage of using high-quality single-crystalline TI films in this context is that a single pair of spin-momentum locked channels spans across the entire film, meaning that only a very small spin current can be pumped from one FM to the other, along the side walls of the film. On the other hand, using nanocrystalline TI films, in which the grains are large enough to avoid hybridization of the TSSs, will effectively increase the number of spin channels available for spin pumping.

In these single crystals, one would expect that skyrmions could exhibit interesting three-dimensional (3D) characteristics. Here, the symmetry of the micromagnetic free energy is investigated. This symmetry permits a complex 3D modulation of a skyrmion string, which we show to be a requirement of a skyrmion coexisting with the conical state. We discuss the implications of this modulation with respect to Thiele’s equation and interskyrmion interactions. Further to this internal modulation, we study theoretically and show experimentally that the strings themselves must contort towards the surfaces of their confining crystals."},{"key":"McCarter_PRL_2022","title":"Structural chirality of polar skyrmions probed by resonant elastic x-ray scattering","authors":"M.R.

Their small length scales coupled with complex, three-dimensional polarization or spin structures makes them demanding to trace out fully. Resonant elastic x-ray scattering (REXS) has emerged as a technique to study chirality in spin textures such as skyrmions and domain walls. It has, however, been used to a considerably lesser extent to study analogous features in ferroelectrics. Here, we present a framework for modeling REXS from an arbitrary arrangement of charge quadrupole moments, which can be applied to nanostructures in materials such as ferroelectrics. With this, we demonstrate how extended reciprocal space scans using REXS with circularly polarized x rays can probe the three-dimensional structure and chirality of polar skyrmions. Measurements, bolstered by quantitative scattering calculations, show that polar skyrmions of mixed chirality coexist, and that REXS allows valuation of relative fractions of right- and left-handed skyrmions. Our quantitative analysis of the structure and chirality of polar skyrmions highlights the capability of REXS for establishing complex topological structures toward future application exploits."},{"key":"Burn_PRB_2022_2","title":"Time-resolved measurement of spin excitations in Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$","authors":"D.M.

Following the identification of the FMR modes at different temperatures using broadband vector network analyzer FMR, we use DFMR on the crystalline (001) Bragg peak to reveal the time-dependent spin configurations of the selected FMR modes. By being able to measure both the amplitude and phase response of the spin system across the resonance, a continuous phase advance (of 180◦) in the conical mode and a phase lag (of 180◦) in the field-polarized mode is found. By performing dynamic measurements in the conical phase as a function of the linear polarization angle of the x rays, i.e., successively probing the dynamics of the moments, we find an inversion of the dynamics along the conical axis upon inverting the applied field direction.

We report here on the behavior of chiral DWs at ultrashort timescale after optical pumping in perpendicularly magnetized asymmetric multilayers. The magnetization dynamics is probed using time-resolved circular dichroism in x-ray resonant magnetic scattering (CD-XRMS). We observe a picosecond transient reduction of the CD-XRMS, which is attributed to the spin current-induced coherent and incoherent torques within the continuously varying spin texture of the DWs. We argue that a specific demagnetization of the inner structure of the DW induces a flow of spins from the interior of the neighboring magnetic domains. We identify this time-varying change of the DW texture shortly after the laser pulse as a distortion of the homochiral Néel shape toward a transient mixed Bloch-Néel-Bloch texture along a direction transverse to the DW"},{"key":"Dabrowski_NanoLett_2021","title":"Transition metal synthetic ferrimagnets: tuneable media for all-optical switching driven by nanoscale spin current","authors":"M.

Switching occurs between two equivalent remanent states with antiparallel alignment of the Ni3Pt and Co magnetic moments, and is observable over a broad temperature range.

We observe regions in the magnetic field-cooling phase diagram in which the skyrmion phase apparently coexists with the conical phase. However, such a coexistence is forbidden due to symmetry arguments. Instead, the skyrmion strings themselves are periodically modulated along their axes, as confirmed by micromagnetic simulations. The periodic modulation is in fact a necessary consequence of the evolution of the skyrmion phase out of the conical state and should therefore be a universal property of skyrmion strings in chiral helimagnets."},{"key":"Gladczuk_PRB_2021","title":"Spin-current mediated exchange coupling in MgO-based magnetic tunnel junctions","authors":"L.

This suggests that the skyrmion structure is a complex 3D structure rather than an identical planar texture throughout the layer stack. The analyses of the spin textures confirm the theoretical predictions that the dipole–dipole interactions together with the external magnetic field play an important role in stabilizing sub‐100 nm diameter skyrmions and the hybrid structure of the skyrmion domain wall.

This shows how the available magnetization reversal routes can be manipulated and the system can be trained."},{"key":"Walton_JNP_2015","title":"Limitations in Artificial Spin Ice path selectivity: the challenges beyond topological control","authors":"S.K.

We have shown previously that magnetic monopole defects exist in artificial spin ice (ASI) and result from two bar switching at a vertex. To create and manipulate monopole defects and indeed magnetic charge in general, path selectivity of the domain wall at a vertex is required. We have recently shown that in connected ASI structures, transverse wall chirality (or topology) determines wall path direction, but a mechanism known as Walker breakdown, where a wall mutates into a wall of opposite chirality partially destroys selectivity. Recently it has been claimed that in isolated Y-shaped junctions that support vortex walls, selectivity is entirely determined by chirality (or topology), the suggestion being that vortex wall chirality is robust in the Walker breakdown process. Here we demonstrate that in Y-shaped junctions, magnetic switching in the important topologically protected regime exists only for a narrow window of field and bar geometry, and that it will be challenging to access this regime in field-driven ASI. This work has implications for the wider field of magnetic charge manipulation for high density memory storage."},{"key":"Burn_JAP_2014","title":"Control of domain wall pinning by localised focused Ga$^+$ ion irradiation on Au capped NiFe nanowires","authors":"D.M.

The effects of irradiation dose and the length of the irradiated features were investigated experimentally. The results are considered in the context of detailed quasi-static micromagnetic simulations, where the ion-induced modification was represented as a local reduction of the saturation magnetization. Simulations show that domain wall pinning behavior depends on the magnitude of the magnetization change, the length of the modified region, and the domain wall structure. Comparative analysis indicates that reduced saturation magnetisation is not solely responsible for the experimentally observed pinning behavior."},{"key":"Burn_PRB_2014","title":"Dynamic interaction between domain walls and nanowire vertices","authors":"D.M.

This interaction has been explored through both magneto-optical Kerr effect experiments and micromagnetic simulations on single-vertex structures. Differences in the micromagnetic structure of incident domain walls in the dynamic regime have a significant influence on the interaction. We observe an oscillatory path selection with increasing domain wall propagation distance preceding the vertex. Our analysis shows that this behavior originates from cyclic reversals of the transverse domain wall chirality due to Walker breakdown processes."},{"key":"King_APL_2014","title":"Local Control of Magnetic Damping in Ferromagnetic/Non-magnetic Bilayers by Interfacial Intermixing induced by Focused Ion-Beam Irradiation","authors":"J.A.

The reversal behavior shows that competing effects govern the switching fields in these structures, giving a minimum as a function of modulation wavelength, showing promising results for improved control of domain-wall propagation behavior. The experimental results were interpreted with detailed micromagnetic simulations and an analytical model, based on the demagnetization effects of the modulation upon the spin structure of the wire.

NiFe/Au bilayers with different thickness were irradiated with a focused 30 keV Ga\u003csup\u003e+\u003c/sup\u003e ion beam, and the evaluation of the individual layers and interfaces were investigated systematically as a function of a broad range of irradiation fluence using grazing incidence x ray reflectivity (GIXRR) and angular dependent x ray fluorescence (ADXRF) techniques carried out at synchrotron radiation sources. Experimental data were collected from 1.3 mm × 4.5 mm structures, and irradiation of such a broad areas with a 100-nm-wide focused ion beam is a challenging task. Two irradiation regimes were identified: For Ga\u003csup\u003e+\u003c/sup\u003e fluences \u003c 15.6 × 10\u003csup\u003e14\u003c/sup\u003e ion/cm\u003csup\u003e2\u003c/sup\u003e (low dose regime), the main influence of the focused ion beam is on the interface and, beyond this dose (high dose regime), sputtering effects and ion implantation becomes significant, eventually causing amorphization of the bilayer system. The broadening of the NiFe/Au interface occurs even at the lowest dose, and above a critical fluence (Φ = 1.56 × 10\u003csup\u003e14\u003c/sup\u003e ion/cm\u003csup\u003e2\u003c/sup\u003e) can be represented by an interfacial-intermixed layer (Ni\u003csub\u003ex\u003c/sub\u003eFe\u003csub\u003ey\u003c/sub\u003eAu\u003csub\u003e(1-x-y)\u003c/sub\u003e; x = 0.5-0.6, y = 0.1-0.15) formed between the NiFe and Au layers. The thickness of this layer increases with irradiation fluence in the low dose regime. A linear relationship is found between the squared intermixing length and irradiation fluence, indicating that FIB-induced mixing is diffusion controlled. The ballistic model fails to describe FIB-induced intermixing, indicating that thermodynamical factors, which might be originated from FIB specific features, should be taken into account. Despite the complexity of the chemical and structural formation, good agreement between the experiment and theory highlights the functionality of the combined GIXRR and ADXRF techniques for studying intermixing in high resolution."},{"key":"Burn_JAP_2010","title":"Complex pulsed field magnetization behavior and Walker breakdown in a NiFe thin-film","authors":"D.M.
