Until recently, macroscopic understanding of the dynamic magnetization behavior in such materials was obtained through ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) measurements where micromagnetic simulations and theoretical modelling were used to predict the microscopic behavior. Here we present our recently developed synchrotron-based x-ray technique with the ability to uniquely resolve the dynamic magnetization behavior as a function of depth through magnetic multilayered systems [1-3]. Reflectometry ferromagnetic resonance (RFMR) brings together the power of two synchrotron x-ray based techniques: Firstly, x-ray detected ferromagnetic resonance (XFMR) provides a element-specific and time-resolved probe to explore the magnetization dynamics [4,5]. Secondly, soft x-ray reflectivity provides a measure of the depth dependence to both the chemical and magnetic structure through multilayered systems. In combination, RFMR reveals new and unique insights into the magnetization dynamics exhibited in layers beneath the surface in multilayered structures. We will present new understanding gained from such layer resolved measurements of the magnetization dynamics in a [CoFeB/MgO/Ta]4 multilayer structure. As expected, each of the magnetic layers exhibit a ferromagnetic resonance behavior. However, in contrast to a single magnetic thin film, additional coupling between the layers results in a phase lag relationship between the dynamics in adjacent layers [1].\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e[1] \u003ca href=\"/publications/Burn_PRL_2020\"\u003eD.M.

The skyrmion pocket has a wide temperature-field window extending up to room temperature [2,3] which can be manipulated through changes to the sample thickness [2,4].

In particular, it has been observed that thin NiO films not only transmit but can also enhance a spin current [1, 2]. So far experiments have been limited to the detection of dc spin current and mainly performed on polycrystalline NiO layers. By employing element specific x-ray ferromagnetic resonance (XFMR) [3] we demonstrate transport of an ac spin-current across epitaxial NiO(001) layers, generated via spin pumping within adjacent NiFe layers. We show that in the case of a FeCo/NiO/NiFe multilayer, magnetization precession at the resonant frequency of the NiFe is also observed in the FeCo, with the phase of the precession being very similar in both layers. The amplitude of the precession of the sink FeCo layer (which is a measure of the amplitude of the spin current propagating through NiO) depends on the NiO thickness.  The amplitude reaches a maximum at 6 nm and decays exponentially above this thickness (see Fig.1), in a similar manner to that in both previous experimental reports concerning the dc spin current [1, 2] and theoretical studies [4, 5]. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor comparison, we present results for FeCo/NM(5nm)/NiO/NiFe multilayers, where the NiO is decoupled from the sink layer by insertion of a 5 nm thick non-magnetic (NM) layer of Ag or Pd. Although the magnetization precession of the FeCo sink layer at the NiFe resonance can be observed, its amplitude is nearly one order of magnitude smaller than for the case of directly coupled layers. Furthermore, we observe that the precession of the sink layer is characterized by a bipolar variation of the phase that is a signature of spin transfer torque due to propagation of ac spin current through the NiO layer [3]. Our results confirm the propagation of ac spin current within NiO layers mediated by coherent magnons, rather than by the diffusion of thermal magnons.   \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cimg class=\"img-fluid text-center\" src=\"/images/presentations/abstract_figs/Dabrowski_MMM_19.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e Figure 1.

ES structures are therefore attractive for future data storage device applications such as heat-assisted-magnetic recording (HAMR). In this work we explore the magnetization dynamics of ESs with different magnetic anisotropies and different soft/hard layer thicknesses using time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect (TRMOKE) measurements. We start with epitaxial Laves phase DyFe2/YFe2 structures with in-plane magnetic anisotropy, where winding and precession within the soft YFe2 layers in the [DyFe2(2nm)/YFe2(8nm)]x40 superlattice structure is demonstrated [1]. We show that the ES magnetization dynamics strongly depends upon the magnetic bias field orientation. In particular, for the magnetic field applied along the in-plane hard axis, the magnetization dynamics of the spring can be continuously excited in the field range from 0.5 T down to remanence, allowing the precession to be observed over a wide frequency range of 2.5‚Äì16 GHz. In contrast, for a DyFe2(30nm)/YFe2(7.5nm)/DyFe2(30nm) trilayer ES structure with substantially thicker hard layer and stronger in-plane magnetic anisotropy, the magnetization precession of the spring is heavily damped, with virtually no oscillations observed beyond an inflection point at around 30 ps after excitation by the fs laser pulse, regardless of the applied magnetic field direction and the pump laser fluence. Finally, we present a [Co(0.4nm)/Pt(0.9nm)]x10/Py(10nm) bilayer structure, where a 90¬∞ exchange spring between out-of-plane and in-plane magnetization orientation is formed within the Co/Pt layers. We show that for the field applied perpendicular to the sample plane the magnetization precession can be observed over a wide frequency range of 2.5‚Äì21 GHz. The precession is even present at the highest available magnetic field of 1.5 T, suggesting mutual imprinting of the spin configuration between the layers [2].  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e[1] L.

Such a structure can be realised with an exchange spring. These are usually engineered with anisotropies such that the moments of both hard and soft layers are aligned in the same direction, either in-plane (IP) or out-of-plane (OoP). If instead the hard and soft layers have different anisotropy directions (IP and OoP) then the exchange coupling creates a canted magnetic state at remanence. Using x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) and x-ray ferromagnetic resonance (XFMR) at the Co and Fe L2,3 edges [4], at both the Advanced Light Source in the US and the Diamond Light Source in the UK, we have studied the effect of inserting a Pt spacer layer on the exchange coupling within [Co/Pt]/(Pt)/Py (tri-)bi-layer exchange springs with canted magnetic moments (Py = Fe20Ni80).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e Samples of Pt(300)/[Co(2)/Pt(9)]10/Pt(x)/Py(y)/Pt(30) (thickness in √Ö) were grown on Al2O3 (11-20) substrates, using DC magnetron sputtering, with x = 0 and 15 √Ö and y = 550 and 100 √Ö. By making the Py layer (y = 550 √Ö) thick compared to the 110 √Ö [Co/Pt] layer, the Co moments are canted from the OoP direction. Element resolved hysteresis loops, measured by XMCD, show that the IP shape anisotropy of the Py dominates and pulls the Co moments from their preferred OoP direction towards the IP direction. Using the thinner Py layer, the Py at the interface is instead canted towards the OoP direction, while the Py magnetization relaxes towards the in-plane direction away from the interface. By inserting a Pt spacer layer, the exchange coupling was decreased, resulting in Co moments that were less strongly canted. For samples with the thickness in this study a static exchange coupling was always observed. The canting of the moments is in agreement with work by Hsu and Saravanan et al.

See Fig 1 for IP field scans of the resonance amplitude measured by XFMR at the Fe and Co L2,3 edges for a 4GHz RF-field. Vector network analyser FMR (VNA-FMR) was also performed with biasing field IP and OoP.

One family of nanomagnetic arrays, characvterized by strong and frustrated magnetic interactions are the artificial spin ices (ASI). ASI structures have provided vast amounts of physical insight in recent years [1,2,3,4] in part due to their ability to model complex systems [5] and exhibit exotic phenomena such as √¢‚Ç¨Àúmagnetic monopole√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢-like states [6]. The power of these networks stems from the extraordinary number of unique microstates, even in systems comprising relatively few nanostructures.

An experimental means to prepare all potential microstates has huge implications, including realising ASI as a tunable-bandgap magnonic crystal [7] or reconfigurable neural-network [8].

Though rarely reported, this is a decent length scale for carrying out soft x-ray scattering experiments. Here we present our recent studies on the magnetic characterization of chiral magnets, using resonant elastic x-ray scattering (REXS). We demonstrate the unique advantages of REXS that allow for the study of the microscopic structural information of skyrmions, inaccessible to other characterization techniques. First, we show that REXS is extremely surface sensitive [1], which allows for the probing of the multidomain skyrmion lattice state - a surface state of the skyrmion lattice [2]. Second, the variable probing area allows us to map out the real-space skyrmion domain structure [3], which is important for future applications. Third, we show that using circularly polarised light, REXS is capable to accurately determine the topological winding number of a skyrmion, rigorously following its mathematical definition [4]. This 'topology determination principle' is a general experimental strategy, applicable to a wide range of topologically ordered magnetic materials.

Therefore, the manipulation of skyrmion arrays in a shift-register-like fashion is one of the key technical requirements for practical device applications. Though moving skyrmions by spin transfer torque has been proven to be effective, the electrical current will eventually dissipate in the form of Joule heat. Here, we demonstrate local Joule heating-free method of manipulation that can translate skyrmions via a magnetic field gradient. A circular field gradient alone is sufficient to drive collective and continuous rotation of the skyrmion lattice. We were able to unambiguously confirm the motion in an in-situ resonant magnetic scattering experiment, as shown in Fig.1. The skyrmion lattice diffraction peaks hereby undergo a continuous rotational motion, generated purely by a set of permanent magnets. We further experimentally rule out other possible driving forces, such as thermal gradients, as well as x-ray-induced effects. We present a theoretical analysis of the skyrmion motion in support of our observations.

As well as being a popular area for scientific study, the potential for the development of novel technological devices is also important. So far resistance changes as a function of magnetisation, known as magnetoresistance, has been most extensively explored. Now electrical control of the magnetisation is becoming a more popular avenue to explore [1]. In particular, systems with a magnetic layer and a layer with high spin-orbit coupling give rise to interesting interfacial effects. An electrical charge current in the high spin-orbit layer generates a transverse spin current. This spin current exerts a spin-orbit torque on magnetic moments in an adjacent magnetic layer and can manipulate the magnetisation [2,3].\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e We have performed soft x-ray reflectivity measurements on CoFeTaB/Pt bilayers which probe the depth dependence to both the structural and magnetic properties within the system.

By applying additional static magnetic field or DC current, modifications to the hysteresis loop shape show that the current driven reversal is complex and cannot simply be described as a purely field-like effect. These modifications may be attributed to changes in the anisotropy with strong links to the spin-orbit interaction. Furthermore, circular dichroism in the x-ray absorption is only observed for the field-driven magnetisation reversal loops suggesting fundamental physical differences between the current- and field-driven magnetisation reversal processes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003cimg class=\"img-fluid text-center\" src=\"/images/presentations/abstract_figs/Burn_Magnetism_17.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFig 1: Current-driven magnetization reversal in CoFeTaB/Pt detected by X-ray reflectivity\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e[1] Slonczewski, J., Journal of Magnetism and Magnetic Materials 159, L1 (1996).\n\u003cbr\u003e[2] Miron, I.

This was done to test whether nano-disk arrays can be well described as an artificial 2D-XY dipolar system [1-3]. The 2D-XY system with exchange interactions has been well understood by the Berenzinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) model [4, 5], and the 2D-XY system with purely dipolar interaction presents an interesting variation to study.

Damping has, therefore, received significant research effort, both in terms of the fundamental physics involved and for technological applications. In general, the control of magnetic properties at the micro- and nano-scale is important for technological applications. Focused ion beam irradiation provides the opportunity for such highly-localised control and modification of magnetic properties. Here the influence of interfacial intermixing on the picosecond precessional magnetisation dynamics of ferromagnetic/non-magnetic thin-film bilayers was studied [1]. Low-dose focused-ion-beam irradiation was shown to affect various aspects of the intrinsic magnetisation behaviour in such bilayers [2]. The influence on damping of ion-beam induced intermixing across the interface between a 10 nm Ni\u003csub\u003e81\u003c/sub\u003eFe\u003csub\u003e19\u003c/sub\u003e layer and a 2-3 nm capping layer of either Au or Cr was studied here. Time-resolved MOKE was used to study magnetisation dynamics and determine the damping as a function ion-beam dose.

Furthermore, field-dependent damping measurements of the NiFe/Au films showed the damping decreased steadily with increasing frequency, indicating an extrinsic two-magnon type contribution to the damping, that may be attributed to increasing disorder at the interface. This contrasts with the behavior observed for MBE grown Au on Fe, where the damping was enhanced by spin-pumping effects. For the NiFe/Cr the damping was invariant with increasing precessional frequency. This indicates an enhancement of the intrinsic damping with Cr cap, which contrasts with the effect of Cr on Fe observed for MBE grown samples reported elsewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e [1] \u003ca href=\"#!/publications/King_APL_2014\"\u003eJ.A.

The kagome lattice shows a cooperative freezing transition while square lattice shows no such transition in the temperature range studied (2 - 300 K). This demonstrates that the magnetic properties of our arrays are governed by the lattice geometry, rather than the properties of a single disk.

The building block of such frustrated lattices is the equilateral triangle because it cannot support simple antiparallel ordering. A two dimensional array of corner sharing triangles is known as the kagome lattice and a three-dimensional array of corner sharing tetrahedral is known as pyrochlore. Magnetic pyrochlore chemical compounds (spin ices) have recently attracted much attention with the observation of emergent magnetic monopoles, but they have limitations as model frustrated systems: tuning the lattice parameter by chemical doping tends to break the symmetry, specific defects cannot be engineered and the spins cannot be directly imaged. The use of frustrated artificial nanostructures overcomes these problems through the tremendous versatility in array fabrication and compatibility with a suite of magnetic imaging techniques.

With due care to the experimental arrangement MOKE magnetometry can be exquisitely sensitive  to magnetisation changes and can be used to study magnetisation reversal in lithographically patterned structures such as small arrays of nanostructures and individual nanowires. Using the functionally simpler quasi-static focused MOKE arrangement, magnetisation reversal behaviour can be studied as a function of magnetic field. The magnetisation state can be interrogated during the reversal in the case of field driven rotational processes. However, in the case of rapid reversals, for example mediated by domain wall motion in nanowires, the magnetisation process can be followed by interrogating the magnetisation state before and after switching. In the latter case this also presents the opportunity to make multiple measurements and study the stochastic nature of the processes. For lithographically patterned nanostructures typical structures have thicknesses ranging from a few nanometres up to 20 nm. Since the MOKE sensitivity is limited by the skin-depth to the order of 20 nm the technique is highly suited to interrogating the entire thickness of such nanostructures. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eExamples of MOKE measurements on such lithographic nanostructures will be discussed.

In contrast to the more widely used application of MOKE magnetometry for the study of magnetisation processes in thin-films and nanostructures, the magneto-optic Kerr effect can also be used to investigate fundamental aspects of magnetism. Here examples are included which show that under appropriate circumstances the MOKE amplitude obtained from quasistatic measurements can be used to inform on the changes in intrinsic magnetic moment. The method does not give absolute magnetic moment but can show relative changes in moment that can be correlated with direct moment measurements.

This field marks the onset of Walker breakdown, after which a dramatic reduction in the time-averaged velocity occurs due to the nucleation of a vortex core originating from a structural instability in the wall. Further increase in the applied field leads to a gradual increase in velocity interrupted by further breakdown events. Walker breakdown can be suppressed with the application of transverse fields, which shifts breakdown to higher fields [1]. Edge roughness can also suppress Walker breakdown by dissipation of wall energy preventing vortex core formation, but by its nature this is hard to control [2].

Figure 1a shows the experimental results where a change in behaviour occurs between positive and negative offset fields.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\n\u003cp\u003eA qualitative model has been constructed to explain this complex behaviour where magnetisation switching in a thin-film takes place by the propagation of domain walls. By including a thermally activated domain wall process and Walker breakdown in domain wall velocity, this simplified model explains the main features of the complex behaviour found in the experimental results (see figure 1b).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cimg class=\"img-fluid text-center\" src=\"/images/presentations/abstract_figs/Burn_CMMP_09_a.png\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\n\u003cimg class=\"img-fluid text-center\" src=\"/images/presentations/abstract_figs/Burn_CMMP_09_b.png\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e Figure 1:  The change in magnetisation switching from simple step-like behaviour at positive offset fields to complex behaviour at negative offset fields.
