<p> Much of the intrigue and utility of nanomagnetic systems arises from the properties of specific system-wide magnetic configurations, or microstates. From practical applications such as data storage to microstates of fundamental physical and statistical interest such as ground states1,2 or metastable excitations3,4, the ability to prepare systems in any given microstate is of crucial importance. Historically, microstate preparation methods have been somewhat limited â€“ relying on globally-applied or stripline-generated fields and thermalisation protocols to access a limited range of states. Groups have recently demonstrated that the dynamic magnetic charge of a scanning MFM tip may be used to write all conceivable microstates5,6, but requires that the sample is situated within expensive and cumbersome SPM hardware.</p>
    
<p>We present developments and applications of the dynamic magnetic-charge writing method Topological Defect-Driven Magnetic Writing (TMW)6, outlining a fully solid-state and current-addressable SPM-free solution  replacing the MFM tip with alternative magnetic charge sources. This improved technique is leveraged to realise novel reconfigurable magnonic circuit elements, implemented within strongly-interacting nanomagnetic networks.</p>
