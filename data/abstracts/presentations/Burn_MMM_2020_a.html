<p> The understanding and ability to manipulate collective spin excitation modes in topologically ordered magnetic structures offers great potential for the development of novel devices. At present, the understanding of these dynamic magnetization modes is based on ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) studies, probing the bulk of the material system, in conjunction with micromagnetic and theoretical modelling. On the other hand, experimental tools to directly probe complex magnetization dynamics in such spin systems are lacking.  </p>

<p>Here, we will present a novel diffractive ferromagnetic resonance (DFMR) technique with the ability to uniquely resolve the dynamic behavior of individual resonance modes tied to topological spin structures [1]. This new technique brings together the power of two synchrotron x-ray based techniques: Firstly, x-ray detected ferromagnetic resonance (XFMR) provides a chemical- and time-resolved probe to explore the magnetization dynamics [2,3]. Secondly, resonant elastic x-ray scattering (REXS) selectively probes periodic spin structures within the magnetic material [4]. In combination, DFMR reveals new and unique insights into the dynamics of ordered spin systems.</p>
