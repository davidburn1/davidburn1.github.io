<p>The BLADE beamline at Diamond Light Source can is geared towards research into the magnetic properties of thin-film and nanostructured samples. With x-rays in the soft energy regime, element specific measurements can be performed on the L<sub>2,3</sub> absorption edges of transition metals and the M<sub>4,5</sub> edges in rare earth materials. Combined with control over the x-ray polarisation state, both arbitrary linear and circular, allows for the investigation of a wide range of magnetic dichroism phenomena.</p>

<p>Using a focussed x-ray beam and through x-ray scattering techniques it is possible to determine the spatial dependence to the magnetic behaviour within a sample. However with potential applications for magnetic materials in novel technological devices, the temporal behaviour of magnetic thin films and nanostructures is also of considerable interest.  Our understanding of time-dependent dynamical processes is key to the high speed response of future magnetoelectronic, spintronic and spin-orbitronic technologies.</p>

<p>To investigate these time-resolved magnetic phenomena with element sensitivity we are developing pump-probe measurements using the intrinsic pulse structure of x-rays produced by a synchrotron source. By synchronising a magnetic field or electrical current pulse with a variable delay from the arrival time of x-ray photons we can probe the magnetisation dynamics with sub-nanosecond resolution.</p>
