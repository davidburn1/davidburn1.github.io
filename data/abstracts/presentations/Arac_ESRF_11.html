<p>Control over the magnetic properties such as anisotropy, coercivity and saturation magnetisation in magnetic structures is desirable. Modification of the local magnetisation for trapping and manipulating domain walls is highly sought-after for technological applications in information storage and processing.</p>
	
<p>Ion beam irradiation can induce interface mixing and strain relaxation between the different layers, and has become a very popular approach in out-of-plane magnetic systems for which it is well understood that interface anisotropy can be controlled by tuning the interface grading and roughness.  More recently, there have been studies reporting ion beam induced changes in the magnetic properties of in-plane systems. However, a detailed study accounting for the origin of these changes is still missing for in-plane systems.</p>

<p>We have investigated the structural properties of Au/Ni<sub>81</sub>Fe<sub>19</sub>  bilayers as a function of Ga<sup>+</sup> ion dose by means of X-ray reflectivity (XRR) and depth resolved x-ray fluorescence (XRF) using synchrotron radiation. We have also performed Monte-Carlo (SRIM and TRIDYN) simulations to provide further information on the compositional structure of the samples for varying Ga<sup>+</sup> irradiation doses. We have discovered that for an irradiation dose of 10 pC/&mu;m<sup>2</sup> and above the layered structures are destroyed and samples become amorphous-like. We observed that systematic changes in structural and compositional changes in response to Ga<sup>+</sup> irradiation at low doses. XRR and TXRF measurements and the model used to fit the experimental data give evidence on the widening of the Au/Ni<sub>81</sub>Fe<sub>19</sub>  interface width due to an increase in topological roughness and chemical intermixing by increasing Ga<sup>+</sup> irradiation dose.  Moreover, experimentally observed results are well predicted by SRIM and TRIDYN simulations suggesting the validity of the presented model.</p>
