<p>Domain walls (DWs) in magnetic nanostructures have long been a subject of much interest[1]. The majority of work so far has focused on 90<sup>o</sup> and 180<sup>o</sup> DWs. However, recently the field has seen promising developments in 360<sup>o</sup> DWs, stable topological defects consisting of two strongly-coupled 180<sup>o</sup> DWs of opposite chirality[1]. 360<sup>o</sup> DWs have several interesting properties relating to behaviour in applied field[3], interactions with spin-waves[2] and high density DW systems such as racetrack memory. [4].</p>

<p>Here we demonstrate a novel 360<sup>o</sup> DW injection technique using an MFM tip. This enables the introduction of DWs of desired chirality to any point in a structure. When the injection point is separated from other micromagnetic features by more than a 360<sup>o</sup> DWs width, the 360<sup>o</sup> DW is stable. When injected close to a magnetic junction, the 360<sup>o</sup> DW is unstable and collapses in a chirality-dependent manner. Choosing injection points carefully allows the injected DWs to mediate controlled switching events throughout the nanostructure, resulting in new magnetisation states.</p>

<p>Using MFM data supported by micromagnetic simulations we demonstrate the utility of this as a tool for controlling global magnetisation states of nanostructures comprised of interconnected nanowires without applied current or global field. </p>
