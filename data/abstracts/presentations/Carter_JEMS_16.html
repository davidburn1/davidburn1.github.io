<p>Domain walls (DWs) in magnetic nanostructures have long been a subject of much interest[1]. The majority of work so far has focused on 90° and 100° DWs. However, recently the field has seen promising developments in 360° DWs, stable topological defects consisting of two strongly-coupled 180° DWs of opposite chirality[2] 360° DWs have several interesting properties relating to behaviour in applied field[3], interactions with spin-waves[4] and high density DW systems such as racetrack memory[4]. Here we demonstrate their utility as a tool for controlling global magnetization states of nanostructures comprised of interconnected nanowires.</p>

<p>By using a novel 360° DW injection technique we are able to introduce DWs of desired chirality to any point in a
structure. Choosing these points carefully allows the injected DWs to mediate controlled switching events
throughout the nanostructure, resulting in new magnetization states without the application of a global field or current. This behaviour is confirmed via MFM data supported by micromagnetic simulations.</p>
