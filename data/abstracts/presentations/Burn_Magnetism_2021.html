    The understanding and ability to manipulate magnetization dynamics in magnetic multilayered structures offers great potential for the development of novel devices. Until recently, macroscopic understanding of the dynamic magnetization behavior in such materials was obtained through ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) measurements where micromagnetic simulations and theoretical modelling were used to predict the microscopic behavior. Here we present our recently developed synchrotron-based x-ray technique with the ability to uniquely resolve the dynamic magnetization behavior as a function of depth through magnetic multilayered systems [1-3]. Reflectometry ferromagnetic resonance (RFMR) brings together the power of two synchrotron x-ray based techniques: Firstly, x-ray detected ferromagnetic resonance (XFMR) provides a element-specific and time-resolved probe to explore the magnetization dynamics [4,5]. Secondly, soft x-ray reflectivity provides a measure of the depth dependence to both the chemical and magnetic structure through multilayered systems. In combination, RFMR reveals new and unique insights into the magnetization dynamics exhibited in layers beneath the surface in multilayered structures. We will present new understanding gained from such layer resolved measurements of the magnetization dynamics in a [CoFeB/MgO/Ta]4 multilayer structure. As expected, each of the magnetic layers exhibit a ferromagnetic resonance behavior. However, in contrast to a single magnetic thin film, additional coupling between the layers results in a phase lag relationship between the dynamics in adjacent layers [1].
